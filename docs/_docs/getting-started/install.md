## Local

If you want to install FreeGenes Python locally, you can install from pip:

```bash
$ pip install freegenes
```

or install directly from source:

```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/vsoch/freegenes-python
cd freegenes-python
python setup.py install
```

Next, read about getting started with the [python client]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/getting-started/python-client/),
or (coming soon) getting started with the [command line client]().
